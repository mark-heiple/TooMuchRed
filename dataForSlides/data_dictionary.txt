receipts_outlays.csv
---------------------
This file contains overall GDP, outlays, receipts, and surplus/deficets from 1940-2015. It includes values in current dollars, 2009 dollars, and % GDP. This comes from hist01z1.xls, hist01z2.xls, hist01z3.xls, hist10z1.xls

Note: the % GDP values are calculated by current dollars/current GDP. It does NOT use the 2009 values. The defator value used to calculate 2009 GDP and outlay values are different for some reason. All dollar amounts are millions.

All of the outlays_by_category data sets come from hist03z1.xls, outlays by super function and function. The spread sheet has super functions, with some broken down by function. The super function is the sum of its functions.

outlays_by_category_summary_pct_outlays.csv
outlays_by_category_summary.csv
--------------------------------------------

The data sets are separated as follows:
outlays_by_category_full_*: data sets contain both super function and functions
outlays_by_category_details_*: data sets contain only the sub functions, or if none the super function
outlays_by_category_summary_*: data sets contain only the super function

In addition, each of the _full_, _details_, and _summary_ data sets represent the data as follows:
(no suffix): data is in current dollars (not adjusted for inflation).
*_pct_gdp: data is represented as % of GDP
*_pct_outlays: data is represented as % of total outlays (grand total is 100%)
